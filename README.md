These are packaging files for MMS, the MongoDB monitoring service that's produced by 10gen. These are not official packaging tools in any capacity and are not endorsed/managed by my employer (Red Hat) or 10gen.

If you know how to build packages then the files in this repo should be pretty self-explanatory. The files for Ubuntu & Debian are in `debian` and RPM (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL) files are in `redhat`. If you're not sure what to do with these files then you should ask a friend who does; I'll probably publish the deb's and RPM's are some point, though.
